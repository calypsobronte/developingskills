      <h1 class="inspires" align="center">WHAT INSPIRES US</h1>
      <h4 align="center">Our inspiration was to think about the needs of a minority population and how technology could develop their skills into strengths so that we also realize that they exist and that we all are and think differently The project will not resolve that it be taken as a means of entertainment and not as an educational tool.

This project will help educational institutions, foundations and families. In addition, its users will be people with mild intellectual and cognitive disabilities (Down syndrome), as well as families and caregivers and those directly responsible for these people.

It is a relevant project to guarantee more and more inclusive spaces in society through technology, but it depends on a locality as it was thought and created for a specific population, what is sought is that the content contributes to their cognitive processes, for which the population in general is not exempt since they must lead the use and development of the application.</h4>
